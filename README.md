# Fabric / Crashlytics deployer

Deploys to Fabric / Crashlytics beta testing service

**Included Crashlytics.framework version:**

* `Crashlytics.framework/submit`: 1.3.5 (15)

## Create your own Step:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Copy the files from the [step-template repository](https://github.com/steplib/step-template)
3. Commit and push it

Hurray, you just created your first Step repository!
You can now start coding and when you're ready
you can submit your Step to the [Open Step Library](http://www.steplib.com/).


## Structure

### step.sh

This is the **entry point of the Step**. A StepLib
system will execute this file when it runs the Step.
You can run other scripts and programs from
*step.sh*. For example if you want to write your
Step in ruby then all you have to include in the *step.sh*
file is the code to run your own ruby script,
something like this:

  #!/bin/bash

  THIS_SCRIPT_DIR="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" && pwd )"

  ruby "${THIS_SCRIPT_DIR}/my_ruby_script.rb"
  exit $?


**inputs**: a Step should get it's inputs through
*environment variables*. These inputs can be (and should be)
specified in the *step.yml* description of the Step.

**exit code**: the exit code generated by step.sh
is interpreted as the success/failure code of the whole Step.
If it returns 0 the Step will be considered as successful.
If it returns with a greater than 0 exit code then
the Step is considered to be failed.


### step.yml

Description of the step in YAML format.

Specifies information for StepLib users like what platforms
the Step supports, what's the official website of the
Step, where can a user find the Step's code and
where can a user fork the Step.

Also defines an input list for the Step which then
can be presented as User Interface for the Step
and a StepLib compatible system can interpret these
inputs and map the user input values to
environment variables which will be available for the Step.

For a full description of the *step.yml* description
file see the documentation on GitHub: [https://github.com/steplib/steplib/blob/master/docs/step_format.md](https://github.com/steplib/steplib/blob/master/docs/step_format.md)


### LICENSE

We don't accept steps into the StepLib without a license included in it!
Read more about why it's important to have a license file
in your open source repository on GitHub: [https://github.com/steplib/steplib/blob/master/templates/step/LICENSE](https://github.com/steplib/steplib/blob/master/templates/step/LICENSE).


### README.md

Technically README is not required but we strongly suggest
against not using one.

It can be a very simple description of what your Step does,
in just a couple of sentences.

Best practice is to include information about how
someone else can contribute to the development of the Step.

You can also include a link to the StepLib website, including your
own Step's page on StepLib (once it's submitted
into the Open StepLib collection), something like this:

This Step is part of the [Open StepLib](http://www.steplib.com/),
you can find its page on StepLib [here](http://www.steplib.com/step/your-step-id).


## How to submit your Step into the Open Step Library

To submit a Step to the [Open Step Library](http://www.steplib.com/)
you have to create a pull-request in the StepLib's spec repository
and include your step's `step.yml` description file
in the **steps/** folder.
